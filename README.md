# Summary

We study a specific solution concept of the canonical consumption-savings problem _Ã  la_ Allen & Carroll (2001). We use the machine learning toolbox to approximate the optimal rule with the help of tensors. We aim at maximizing the lifetime-reward, by the grandient descent technique, repeatedly simulating lives and computing the gradient of the lifetime utilities.
